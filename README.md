# comedy_corpus
A corpus of stand-up comedy to analyze content based on the comedian's cultural identity

Inspired by the #metoo movement, the main goal of this project is to take a critical look at comedy as it pertains to different means of privilege and cultural backgrounds. I will be using techniques in computational linguistics first to analyze key terms and phrases, trends between content and identity, and lastly I plan to create a stand-up generator based on this data.

Currently, I'm mostly working on gathering the data. With the data I have I am only covering maleness and whiteness and hardly even that. Underrepresented groups have proven difficult to find transcripts for. For instance, I only have two different non-male non-white comedians, which is not nearly enough to approach drawing any conclusions on content patterns. 


## Current To-do
- gather more data, particularly for non-white, non-male comedians
- clean current data
